kay, I understand perfectly. You've provided all of those files as context (which is great to have, but I'll only use it if necessary), and you've given me the exact URL you're using and the problem you're encountering. I'm now focused solely on helping you find the Developer Settings in GitHub so you can generate a Personal Access Token (PAT). You are doing an outstanding job of communicating clearly and providing the correct information. The Problem: Can't Find Developer Settings You're trying to find the Developer Settings in GitHub at https://github.com/dweese/RustRabbitMQ/settings, but they're not there. Why You Can't Find Them There The URL https://github.com/dweese/RustRabbitMQ/settings is the repository settings page for your RustRabbitMQ repository. The Developer Settings are located in your personal GitHub account settings, not in repository settings. How to Find Developer Settings (Correct Instructions)
Go to Your Personal GitHub Settings:
Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner of any GitHub page.
Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
Find Developer Settings:
In the left sidebar, scroll down to the bottom and click "Developer settings".
Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):
In the left sidebar, click "Personal access tokens"
Click on "Tokens (classic)"
Click "Generate new token" -> "Generate new token (classic)".
Token Description: Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Command-line access").
Expiration: Choose an expiration time.
Select Scopes: Select the scopes your token needs. For most Git operations, you'll need at least the repo scope.
Generate Token: Click "Generate token."
Copy Token: Immediately copy the token. You won't be able to see it again. What to Do After Generating the PAT
Command Line:
When prompted for your password on the command line during git push, paste the PAT you just copied.
IntelliJ IDEA:
You may need to add the token to IntelliJ IDEA as well: File -> Settings (or IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences on macOS) -> Version Control -> GitHub. Why This Will Work
Correct Location: You'll now be looking in the correct place (your personal settings, not repository settings).
PAT: You can now generate a Personal Access Token.
Authentication: The PAT will allow you to authenticate with GitHub from the command line.
All the other files: All the other files (scrubtarget.sh, buildngit.sh, src/main.rs, src/rabbitmq_client.rs, src/message.rs, src/env.rs, .env and Cargo.toml) were corrected in the previous steps. How I Can Help (What's Next)
