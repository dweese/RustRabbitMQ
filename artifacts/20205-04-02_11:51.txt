## Me
I need to restart the IDE.  I would appreciate it if you could write a cogent summary of our work, including my sorta-confusion and slow-learning issues, heh.

# Project Restructuring Summary

## What We Were Trying to Fix

We've been working on fixing a Rust project structure for a RabbitMQ test framework. The main issue was confusion about how modules should be organized and which code belongs in which file.

## Initial Confusion

The project started with a proper `main.rs` file, but there were issues with the `test_runner.rs` module:

1. The `test_runner.rs` file was attempting to redeclare modules that were already declared in `main.rs`
2. There was confusion about using `mod` vs `use crate::` statements
3. Later, there was an attempt to essentially duplicate the `main()` function content inside the `test_runner.rs` file

## The Correct Structure

We established that:

1. **Module declarations** with `mod config;`, `mod env;`, etc. should only exist in `main.rs`
2. **Module imports** with `use crate::config;`, etc. should be used in `test_runner.rs` to access those modules
3. Only `main.rs` should have a `main()` function
4. `test_runner.rs` should have a `pub async fn run_config_tests()` function that's called from `main.rs`

## Key Learning Points

1. In Rust, you declare modules with `mod` once in the codebase (typically in `main.rs` or `lib.rs`)
2. You use these modules with `use crate::module_name` in other files
3. The `with()` method for `tracing_subscriber` requires importing `tracing_subscriber::prelude::*`
4. Each module should have its own focused responsibility

## Next Steps

After restarting your IDE, you should:

1. Ensure `main.rs` has all the `mod` declarations and calls `test_runner::run_config_tests().await?`
2. Create a simplified `test_runner.rs` with just the test runner functionality
3. Make sure all necessary imports use `use crate::module_name` syntax in `test_runner.rs`

This should help organize your code more effectively while preserving the functionality you need.
