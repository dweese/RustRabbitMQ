# Summary of Recent Changes to RabbitMQ Configuration

We've redesigned the RabbitMQ configuration structure to create a more organized, maintainable, and extensible system. Here's what we accomplished:

## Configuration Structure Improvements

1. **Created a hierarchical configuration model** with separate concerns:
   - `RabbitConfig`: The top-level container for all RabbitMQ settings
   - `ConnectionConfig`: Core connection parameters (username, password, host, port, etc.)
   - `TestSettings`: Test-specific configuration options
   - `AdvancedSettings`: Advanced RabbitMQ parameters for future expansion

2. **Established clear separation of concerns** by grouping related settings together, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

3. **Improved extensibility** by designing a structure that can accommodate new RabbitMQ features without requiring substantial refactoring.

4. **Applied sensible defaults** for optional parameters, requiring only essential connection information to be explicitly provided.

## Benefits for Testing and Development

1. **Same configuration structure for both production and test environments**, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.

2. **Isolated test settings** that don't contaminate production configuration.

3. **Flexibility for test harnesses** to override specific configuration components without rebuilding the entire structure.

4. **Forward compatibility** through the advanced settings section, allowing for future RabbitMQ features to be integrated smoothly.

## Code Sample

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct RabbitConfig {
    pub connection: ConnectionConfig,
    #[serde(default)]
    pub test_settings: TestSettings,
    #[serde(default)]
    pub advanced: AdvancedSettings,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ConnectionConfig {
    pub username: String,
    pub password: String,
    pub host: String,
    pub port: u16,
    pub vhost: Option<String>,
    #[serde(default = "default_timeout")]
    pub connection_timeout_ms: u64,
    #[serde(default = "default_heartbeat")]
    pub heartbeat_seconds: u16,
    #[serde(default)]
    pub tls_enabled: bool,
}
```

This structure provides a clean foundation for RabbitMQ integration that can grow with the application's needs while maintaining backward compatibility and supporting effective testing strategies.
